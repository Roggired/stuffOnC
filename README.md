# stuffOnC

This repo contains my own experiments on C. If you want to, you are welcome to review the code and add issues. 

Current version contains:  
- **Graph structure**  
 Undirected graph, may contains cycles and based on nodes and lists of children nodes.  
 Contains two finding algorithms: depth-first search (dfs) and breadth-first search (bfs).
 For findings in a cycled graph algorithms use coloring.  
- **Graph writer**   
 Writes a graph on stdout using bfs algorithm.
